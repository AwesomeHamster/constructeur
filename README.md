# DEPRECATED - Use [Koishi's Boilerplate Project](https://koishi.chat/en-US/manual/starter/boilerplate.html) Instead

This project is deprecated, it was useful in the days that Koishi side has no an official bundler setup for plugins development.

Since Koishi Team release their [official boilerplate project](https://koishi.chat/en-US/manual/starter/boilerplate.html) that includes build / bundle command for developing plugins,
the `constructeur` could be deprecated and I would no longer maintain it.
